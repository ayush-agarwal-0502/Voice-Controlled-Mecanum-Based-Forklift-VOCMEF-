# Voice-Controlled-Mecanum-Based-Forklift-(VOCMEF)-

Skills : Mechatronics , IoT , Robotics , Electronics , Machine Learning 

This project is made by me ( Ayush Agarwal ) , Shivansh Dubey , Vishal Gosain and Manali Pawar . The CAD files, ML model and its weights , Proteus , Arduino files have been uploaded in this repository itself .

## Introduction and the problem statment taken by us :

After an analysis of videos of the traditional forklifts availaible online , it was observed by me that the present forklift model used in the factories has certain drawbacks which I could solve . Some of those are :

* Forward toppling of the goods being carried 
* Sideways toppling of the goods being carried 
* Overturning / Toppling of the forklift itself 
* Injuries to the human operating the machine 
* Wasteage of large amount of industrial goods

## The VOCMEF (VOice Controlled Mecanum based Forklift )

The above image shows the structure of the VOCMEF as made by me on the CAD software .

The VOCMEF has rollers , 2 DoF Robotic arm like structure , Normal forklift lifting part with additional belt rollers , scissor lifter , double wishbone suspension , Mecanum wheels , central plate like structure , microprocessor etc .

## Operation of the VOCMEF 

The VOCMEF is optimised to lift both boxed goods as well as collection of smaller goods ( which I saw was also one of the things forklifts were used for in the videos ) . 

For the boxed goods , the vocmef approaches from the roller side . First the robotic arms squeeze and hold the box from the side , then the roller rolls , thus making the box lie down on the central plate . This gives the box low center of gravity thus giving advantages which I will explain in the next part . Then , while unloading , the central plate moves up to the height required and the robotic arms push the box , thus being optimised to put the goods at a height too . 

For a collection of objects (say a bunch of metal sheets ) ,
